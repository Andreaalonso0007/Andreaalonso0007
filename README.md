# 👋 Hi, I’m Andrea Alonso (@Andreaalonso0007)

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a cybersecurity professional, full stack developer, and aspiring entrepreneur with a strong foundation in ethical hacking, infrastructure automation, and AI-driven security solutions.
I’m currently developing **RedSentinel**, an intelligent platform for automated penetration testing and risk scoring tailored for SMEs.

My approach combines offensive security (Red Teaming) with scalable automation — bridging technical depth with practical business value. 
I'm also completing a cybersecurity master's degree focused on building realistic corporate lab environments and advanced pentesting workflows.
